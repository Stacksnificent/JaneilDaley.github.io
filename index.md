    <div> <h3> Destiny 2 </h3>
      Bungie is at the center of controversy yet again because of trying to make a "no guardian left behind" kind of video game. The player base feels that it does more harm than good whenever Bungies tries to implement changes that punishes skillful players. Content creators have not minced any words in their videos when giving their thoughts on how AE or the airborne effectiveness stat continues to make the game seem unplayable to them. The last time players felt this way was when stasis was introduced as a subclass element into the game being described as "taking away a steering wheel in a racing game". What do you think? Should other players have to suffer simply because another group of players refuse to invest time into getting better at the game they claim to enjoy?

    <div> <h3> Gotham Knights </h3>
      <div>imagel go here*</div>
      Gotham Knights had a huge buzz already before it's release date for many reasons. Gamers everywhere were so excited to embark on an adventure throughout Gotham City without Batman being the central character. Some of that excitement started to dwindle when some players felt as if the game wouldn't be good due to crucial details coming out right before the release date. The two big details were the combat system not being anything similar to the Batman Arkham games and the game only running at 30fps. Gaming blogs and news outlets everywhere started to dump on it without playing it but after release a lot of the criticism was taken back once players realized Gotham Knights was a beautiful experience with a beautiful story. What do you think? Was it fair to judge the game based off of two details given before playing it?

    <div> <h3> Cyberpunk 2077 </h3>
      Cyberpunk 2077 was another game that had a huge buzz around due to anticipation for the developing company CD Project Red's next game. With next gen consoles being at their pinnacle in terms of sales and newer games being modeled mostly with them in mind everyone was sure that Cyberpunk 2077 would blow everyone away with it's graphics, gameplay, storyline, and open world aspect. As soon as it launched it saw one of the biggest controversies the gaming community has seen since the Activison sexual harassment story. The amount of bugs, glitches, and just straight up crashes happening to some consoles Cyberpunk 2077 was a massive fail of a launch. But with time and attention the game developers got on their jobs and fixed every bug or glitch that plauged the players. If there was an award for "comeback game of the year" Cyberpunk 2077 definitely would have won it. What do you think? Was Cyberpunk 2077 worth another shot or should it have been written off for good?
