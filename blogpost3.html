      Cyberpunk 2077 was another game that had a huge buzz around due to anticipation for the developing company CD Project Red's next game. With next gen consoles being at their pinnacle in terms of sales and newer games being modeled mostly with them in mind everyone was sure that Cyberpunk 2077 would blow everyone away with it's graphics, gameplay, storyline, and open world aspect. As soon as it launched it saw one of the biggest controversies the gaming community has seen since the Activison sexual harassment story. The amount of bugs, glitches, and just straight up crashes happening to some consoles Cyberpunk 2077 was a massive fail of a launch. But with time and attention the game developers got on their jobs and fixed every bug or glitch that plauged the players. If there was an award for "comeback game of the year" Cyberpunk 2077 definitely would have won it. What do you think? Was Cyberpunk 2077 worth another shot or should it have been written off for good?
